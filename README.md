## Practice Project 1: Simple Interest Calculator

This repository contains a **Simple Interest Calculator** implemented as a Bash script (`simple-interest.sh`). It allows users to compute simple interest based on the principal amount, annual interest rate, and time period in years.

### Simple Interest Formula

The calculator uses the standard formula:
Simple Interest (SI) = (Principal × Rate × Time) / 100

- **Principal**: the initial amount of money
- **Rate**: annual interest rate in percentage
- **Time**: time period in years

### How to Use

1. Open a terminal and navigate to this repository.
2. Make the script executable (if necessary):

```bash
chmod +x simple-interest.sh   # Make script executable
./simple-interest.sh          # Run the calculator
```

Enter the requested inputs when prompted:

```text
Enter the principal amount: 1000
Enter the annual interest rate (in %): 5
Enter the time period (in years): 2

Simple Interest: 100.00
```
